*Some Fun Facts*

Yes I totally used the pre-formatted introduction.
I am a nature enthusiaist and philosophically geared individual who really enjoys the challenge of a puzzle or problem that pushes me to learn.
This has led me to pursue projects in a more individual manner, but I do enjoy peer reveiws or collaboration to get new perspectives and ideas.
That's all.
Maybe I will add more in the future.
